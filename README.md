# user-tools

This repository contains community contributed tools. This is different from
[official bpftrace tools][0] in that we do not intend to be as strict about
requirements.

Thus, we encourage users to contribute anything they find useful for the
community. Motivations could include (but are not limited to):

* Sharing useful functionality
* Sharing novel techniques
* Incubating a new official tool

One intention is that all new official tools begin life in this repository. And
over time we'll develop some criteria for promoting a user tool to an official
tool that bpftrace maintainers will help support over long periods of time.
